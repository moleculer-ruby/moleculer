  # Transporter communicates with other nodes. It transfers events, calls requests
  # and processes responses â€¦etc. If multiple instances of a service are running on
  # different nodes then the requests will be load-balanced among them. The whole
  # communication logic is outside of transporter class. It means that you can
  # switch between transporters without changing any line of code.
